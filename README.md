# World of Words

World of Words is a single-page-app that is used to browse the lexicographic
data of Wikidata. Or, put differently, it is a new, modern interface to a
dictionary of all words in all languages.

Go to [World of Words](https://vrandezo.github.io/world_of_words).

You can navigate through the words using the mouse, a touch device, or the
keyboard, using the numpad, or a kind of extended WASD, i.e. the letter
around S and the < and > keys to move between senses.
