I like to start projects.
And I am happy for other people to contribute to them!

If you want to change something, add something, or contribute to the
project, please reach out to me or send a PR.

If you want to take over, I will be happy to hand it over to you.

The best way to reach me is probably on my
[Wikidata User Talk page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User_talk:Denny).
