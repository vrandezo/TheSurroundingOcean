I like to start projects, and love if someone else picks them up. I don't
usually maintain projects myself in the long run.

If you want to work on this project, please reach out to me.
I will be happy to hand it over to you.

The best way to reach me is probably on my [Wikidata User Talk page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User_talk:Denny).
